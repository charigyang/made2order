# Made to Order: Discovering monotonic temporal changes via self-supervised video ordering

## Requirements
```pytorch```,
```Pillow```,
```opencv```,
```einops```,
```tensorboardX```


## How to use 

We have included a demo on how to train on several datsets (RDS, MNIST and SVHN). Check `main.py`. The dataset should be downloaded automatically on the first run (or created on the fly, as in RDS). 

Other datasets will be uploaded in due course.

To run this on your own dataset, simply create a dataloader of the same nature.
